================

`Lattice Microbes <http://www.scs.illinois.edu/schulten/lm>`_ is a software
package for efficiently sampling trajectories from the chemical and
reaction-diffusion master equations (CME/RDME) on high performance computing
(HPC) infrastructure using both exact and approximate methods [ROBE2013]_,
[HALL2014]_. pyLM is a problem solving environment written in Python that
provides an easy to use and highly customizable simulation construction tools
for complex biological scenarios [PETE2013]_. jLM is an alternative Python
interface to Lattice Microbes designed to integrate with Jupyter notebooks.
