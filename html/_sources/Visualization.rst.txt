Visualization using VMD
======================

`Visual Molecular Dynamics <http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/>`_ can be used
to visualize RDME simulation output. If LM was built and installed with VMD
support, the required molfile plugin to load LM trajectories will be installed
automatically. VMD has excellent `documentation
<http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/current/docs.html>`_,  so only LM specific
features of the plugin will be discussed here.

As noted in the Installation section, LM needs to be built, installed and run inside
a conda environment, which is created by a .yml file in Lattice-Microbes/conda_envs. 
Suppose we've used Lattice-Microbes/conda_envs/lm_precomp.yml to create a conda environment 
py37_lm. We can then type the two lines below to launch VMD:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda activate py37_lm
    vmd

Upon a successful launch, we should be able to get the windows in the picture below. 
The window on the left is the **display window**, where our simulation trajectory visualization 
eventually shows up. The window on the bottom right is the **control window**, where 
we can load trajectory files and adjust visualization properties.

Assume we have an RDME simulation output file *gpu1byte.lm*. To load it, we can click the 
*File* dropdown and select *New Molecule...* in the **control window**, as shown below.

A **Molecule File Browser** window shown below will pop up, and we should select *Browse...*. 
In the pop-up window on the right, we can then navigate to *gpu1byte.lm* and click *OK*. 
Finally, we should click *Load* in the **Molecule File Browser** window on the left.

Upon a successful load, we should be able to see the cell in the **display window** shown below.

To adjust visualization parameters, we can select *Representations...* in the *Graphics* dropdown 
of the **control window**.

In the pop-up window, we can first go to the *Selections* tab, select the type of molecules we 
want to see from the *Singlewords* menu, and then click *Apply*.

We can then go to the *Draw style* tab, select our desired *Coloring Method* and *Drawing Method*, 
and click *Apply* at the bottom.

We can also adjust the orientations of the axes in the **display window**, by going to *Axes* 
in the *Display* dropdown of the **control window**.

If we want to change the location of axes and thus choose *UpperLeft*, the **display window** will 
look like below:
